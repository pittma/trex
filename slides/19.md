### Montgomery Multiplication: Initialization

1. Choose a power of two that's greater than $m$, this is $r$.

	```haskell
	r = 2 ^ ceiling (logBase 2 (fromIntegral m))
	```

1. Square $r$, modulo $m$. This we'll call $r_2$.

	```haskell
	r2 = r * r `mod` m
	```

1. Compute the multiplicative inverse of $-m\ \text{mod}\ r$, this is
   $m'$
   
   ```haskell
   m' = inv (negate m) r
   ```
