### I. Chinese Remainder Theorem

we can solve for $x$ with the congruence:

$$
x \equiv (\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot M_i \cdot M_{i}^{-1})\ \text{mod}\ N
$$

Where $M_i$ is $\cfrac{m_1m_2 \dots m_n}{m_i}$ and $M_{i}^{-1}$ is
$M_i$'s multiplicative inverse modulo $m_i$, and $N$ is the product of
all $m$s:

$$
\prod^n_{i=1} m_i
$$
