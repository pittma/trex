## Full Operation

### I. Key generation

* Choose two large primes $p$ and $q$.
* Compute their product, this is $n$.
* Calculate Euler's totient function of $n$ (denoted $\phi(n)$).
* Choose a public exponent $e$ such that $1 \lt e \lt \phi(n)$, and
that $e$ is coprime with $\phi(n)$.
* Compute the private exponent $d$ such that $d \times e =\ 1\
\text{mod}\ \phi(n)$ ($d$ is $e$'s multiplicative inverse $\text{mod}\
\phi(n)$).
