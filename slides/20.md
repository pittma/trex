### Montgomery Multiplication: Montgomery Form


1. Put $a$ into "montgomery form" by multiplying $a * r_2$, this is
   $a_m$.

   ```haskell
   am = a * r2
   ```
 
1. Do a montgomery reduction of $a$, this is $a'$. This routine we'll
   call $\text{reduce}$.

   1. Multiply $a_m$ by $m'\ \text{mod}\ r$, I'll call this $a_m'$

	  ```haskell
	  am' = am * m' `mod` r
	  ```

   1. Do $\cfrac{a_m + a_m' * m}{r}$. This temp value we'll call $t$.

	  ```haskell
	  t = am + am' * m `div` r
	  ```

   1. The result is $t$ if $t < m$, otherwise it's $t - m$.
	  ```haskell
	   if t < m
         then t
         else t - m
	  ```
