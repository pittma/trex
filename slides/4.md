## Simplest possible explanation

### II. Encryption

> To encrypt a message $M$, represent it as a number smaller than $n$
> and compute $C = M^e\ \text{mod}\ n$.

#### Example

Sending the "message" `213`, a six-bit number represented as 3 2-bit
couplets. We can represent this in base 10 as $39$.

$$
\begin{align}
C &= 39^{17}\ \text{mod}\ 91 \\
C &= 65
\end{align}
$$
