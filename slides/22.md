## Who cares?

* $r$, $r_2$, and $m'$ can all be precomputed.
* Instead of $\text{mod}\ n$, the product result is divided by $r$, a
  power of 2.
  
  **This is a right shift**, which is much faster than
  quotient estimation.

* Particularly useful in exponentiation because intermediate results
  can be left in Montgomery Form.
