### I. Chinese Remainder Theorem

The CRT lets us break $C^d\ \text{mod}\ n$ into two congruences, each
with prime moduli.

$$
M = C^d\ \text{mod}\ p \\
M = C^d\ \text{mod}\ q
$$

Once we do this, we get a smaller exponent through Euler's Theorem,
which tells us that:

$$
a^{x\ \text{mod}\ \phi(p)} \equiv a^x\ (\text{mod}\ p)
$$

When $x$ and $p$ are coprime.
