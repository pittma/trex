### I. Chinese Remainder Theorem

The CRT lets us break $C^d\ \text{mod}\ n$ into two congruences, each
with prime moduli.

$$
M = C^d\ \text{mod}\ p \\
M = C^d\ \text{mod}\ q
$$

Once we do this, we can use Euler's Theorem, which is a consequence of
Euler's totient, to have a smaller exponent.

$$
a^{x\ \text{mod}\ \phi(p)} \equiv a^x\ (\text{mod}\ p)
$$

When $x$ and $p$ are coprime.
