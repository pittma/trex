### Montgomery Multiplication

**Compute multiplications in montgomery form.**

1. Put $b$ into Montgomery form and then reduce it as well. This is
   $b'$.

   ```haskell
   bm = b * r2
   b' = reduce bm
   ```
1. compute $c'$, which is a reduction as well, but this time of $a' *
   b'$ instead of $a$ or $b$ times $r_2$.,

   ```haskell
   c' = reduce (a' * b')
   ```

1. Finally, the final result is one last reduction of $c'$.
   ```haskell
   reduce c'
   ```
